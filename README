Porto is a simple TCP port scanner written in C.

For every port, it does send a raw TCP/IP packet with the SYN flag set.
At the same time, it does listen for packets with the SYN and ACK flags set.

As explained in RFC 793 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt>, upon reception
of a SYN segment, if a tcp port is "listening", a SYN and an ACKnowledgement for
the SYN received are sent.

Porto doesn't try to complete the handshake by sending a final ACK. Consequently,
the other side doesn't get to the ESTABLISHED state and hence no connection is
actually happening. This technique is called stealth scanning.
